When adding new fields to the ports table, you need to alter these
files:

class/ports.php
www/commit.php <== should use freshports.php to display port information
database-schema/datatype.txt <== add fields here too.
include/files.php <== this should use freshports.php too!
database-schema/sp.txt <= all types changes above need to be updated here too.
             freshports_commit
